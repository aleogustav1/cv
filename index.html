    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
       My name is Alejandro Colón and, I am 37 years old. I was born in a little island in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico. Since I was a kid
       I have<br> been facinated with sports cars and, technology. After attempting a deegree on Graphic Arts, I decided to take a pause and<br> become
       a automotive technician. After finishing a technical degree at Mech-Tech Puerto Rico, I did a short intership at Autogermana<br> Puerto Rico in
       where at the end of that intership I applied for an open position and got hired as a MINI Cooper technician. I have always loved european<br> cars to begin with and,
       I was very excited to begin my career as a BMW/MINI technician. In 2016, I moved to Denver Colorado<br> where I continued my career as a
       MINI Cooper technician at Ralph Schomp MINI. Three more years passed and, I decided to grow<br> even more by getting to work for a private
       shop, Autoworks Colorado, who works brands like Audi, Volkswagen, BMW, MINI,<br> Mercedes Benz and, Porsche. Now, I find myself pursuing a career as a Web Developer.
